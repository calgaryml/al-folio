The **Calgary Machine Learning Lab**
is a research group led by [Yani Ioannou](https://yani.ai) within the [Schulich School of Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca) at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca).

The lab has a research focus on improving Deep Neural Network (DNN) training and models, in particular for computer vision applications. Topics of research include:
Sparse Neural Network Training, Bias and Robustness of Efficient Deep Learning methods and Domain-Agnostic Self-Supervised Learning (see [Research](projects)).

We collaborate with other research groups within the university with the [Artificial Intelligence Research Group](https://www.calgaryai.org), and broader, on applying machine learning and computer vision to novel problems.
