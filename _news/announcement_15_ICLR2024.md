Mike Lasby's collaborative work with researchers at Google, MIT and the Vector Institute, ["Dynamic Sparse Training with Structured Sparsity"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kOBkxFRKTA) {% cite lasby2024srigl %}, was accepted at ICLR 2024! DST methods learn state-of-the-art sparse masks, but accelerating DNNs with unstructured masks is difficult. SRigL learns structured masks, improving real-world CPU/GPU timings!
